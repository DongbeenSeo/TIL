        The transition-duration property is simple to understand. It defines the total duration of a transition from state A to state B, whether the transition involves scaling, distorting, rotating or modifying the style of an element. The transition-timing-function
        is more difficult as it defines the rate at which the transition is carried out, which can involve speeding up and slowing down. It's all got something to do with Bézier curves as described here: The transition-timing-function property describes
        how the animation will proceed over time. Keywords can be used for common functions or the control points for a cubic bézier function can be given for complete control of the transition function. Rather than trying to work out what all that means,
        lets look at the keyword values for this property and how they affect a simple translation across the page. Move your mouse over the field below and the green boxes should all take off in a race across the page. Each balloon has been assigned
        a different timing function controlling it's progression as it floats from the bottom of the box to the top. The labels show which of the named timing functions has been assigned, apart from the last balloon to which a custom timing function has
        been assigned, namely cubic-bezier(0,1,1,0), causing it to pause half way.
